Upon completion, you will have a solid understanding of the role that **Jenkins** plays in the software development lifecycle, how to install a Jenkins server, how to build software for it, how to manage third party integrations/plugins and how to scale and secure Jenkins. Finally, you will get a glimpse of what you can do to further enhance your **CI/CD** skills.
